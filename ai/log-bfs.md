# Path Finding Algorithm Improvement Summary

The new implementation uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to find valid paths between matching cards with these key rules:

1. **Valid Path Requirements**:
   - Maximum 2 direction changes allowed
   - Can only move through empty spaces or outside the board
   - Must connect two matching cards

2. **Key Features**:
   ```javascript
   {
     position: {x, y},        // Current position
     lastDir: -1,            // Last direction taken (-1 for start)
     dirChanges: 0,          // Number of direction changes (max 2)
     path: []                // Array of positions forming the path
   }
   ```

3. **Path Validation**:
   - Adjacent cards are automatically valid
   - Empty spaces (`null`) are passable
   - Other cards act as obstacles
   - Can move outside board boundaries
   - Must reach target with â‰¤ 2 direction changes

This approach is more systematic and reliable than the previous implementation, following a clear mathematical pathfinding algorithm rather than trying to handle specific cases.
